SpotiAI was born with the aim of laying the foundations for a music recommendation system capable of analyzing song characteristics and user preferences, offering personalized suggestions. To achieve this goal, the project integrates two complementary approaches: logic programming and machine learning.

This project represents the starting point for future developments, aimed at enhancing the adaptability of the system to individual preferences. The goal is to progressively refine the recommendations, in order to generate increasingly flexible and targeted suggestions.
